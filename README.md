# Simon-Says-Game
"A classic 'Simon Says' game implemented digitally, where users must remember and replicate a sequence of colors/sounds generated by the computer, testing their memory and attention to detail. This project provides a fun and interactive way to practice cognitive skills, with adjustable difficulty levels for increasing challenge."
Key features:
Random sequence generation:
The game dynamically creates a sequence of colors/sounds for the user to follow.
User interaction:
Players click or tap the corresponding color/sound to replicate the sequence.
Difficulty levels:
Adjust the length of the sequence to increase the challenge.
Feedback system:
Provides visual and auditory cues to indicate correct or incorrect responses.
Potential applications:
                       - Educational tool for memory development in children
                       - Brain training exercise for adults
                       - A simple coding project to practice basic game development concepts
